Pork Adobo Recipe

Pork Adobo is pork cooked in soy sauce, vinegar, and garlic. This is considered by many as the Philippine’s national dish because of its popularity, ease in preparation, and long storage life. Adobo is not only limited to pork and chicken, other meats, seafoods, and vegetables such as squid, goat meat, veal, beef, shrimp, river spinach can also be cooked this way. This recipe is one of the easiest and best that you will find.

If the word “adobo” is mentioned, at first you might be unsure of what it is pertaining to; is it the Mexican adobo or the version from the Philippines. This recipe is obviously for the Philippine adobo, which is also one of the signature dishes of the Philippines.

As I said, there are different variations in cooking this dish (sometimes called regional versions). The Philippines is composed of around 7,107 islands and cooking pork adobo (or adobo in general) can be different in each place. The main reasons can be the availability of ingredients and tradition — meaning, the way it was handed down from generations or from ethnicity. I am sure that there are other reasons besides these.

This recipe is the most common and probably the simplest of them all. I will try to feature other Adobo variations such as the Batangas Adobo and the Ginataang Adobo in our future posts. You might like to see the list post that I created about 31 different Filipino adobo dishes. This will give you more options and you will get to see a few ways to cook adobo.

If you want me to feature your adobo version, I will be happy to do that. This food blog is not about me; it was created to help and guide home cooks to prepare Filipino and other dishes. I believe that it will be better if our friends and readers can see have options. Contact me if you want to share some recipes.
